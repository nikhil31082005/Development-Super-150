=>  javacript is single threaded,weakly typed,dynamically typed,intepreted programming language
=>  shortest code of js is : empty js file
=> whenever a js code is run a global execution context(GEC) is created inside that GEC we have two phases :
1. MCP (Memory creation phase) :variable,function memory allocated before execution of any line of code
2. CEP(Code execution phase) : start after MCP ->  from top execution -> every line execution 
    whenver a function is called a new execution context is created with the name of the function which also has two phase(same as above)

 ------------------------------Declarative(let,var,const)---------------------------------
 **  reinitialisation : 
 e.g let a =10;
        a  = 'sam'
** redeclaration :
e.g let a =10;
    let a  = 'sam'


var : reinitialisation and redeclaration both is possible
let : reinitialisation possible but redeclaration is not possible
const : reinitialisation and redeclaration both are not possible
